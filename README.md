# homekit2mqtt

HomeKit to MQTT bridge

Depends on [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS) by [KhaosT](https://github.com/KhaosT), all credits belong to him.

I'm using this to control a multitude of different devices in my [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome)-based home automation through siri.

This is a work in progress, better Readme and configuration options will follow asap.

## Installation

```sudo npm install -g homekit2mqtt```

## Configuration

Right now configuration is hardcoded in index.js (see Line 102)
